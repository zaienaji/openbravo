# This is the development trunk of Openbravo ERP.

Original Openbravo ERP repository is not available in git, here I provide manually converted from Openbravo's mercurial pristin main repository to Git.

First, configure make sure **git large file system** (LFS) installed. To install Git LFS, for short in debian based OS:

 1. url -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
 2. sudo apt-get install git-lfs
 3. git lfs install

For further instruction, see [official documentation](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) on how to install Git LFS. You always can refer to [this documentation]([https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/)) on how to use Git LFS.

Then, you can clone this repo.

To perform configuration and installation, see [original readme ](README) from openbravo.
